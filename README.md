It is prototype of a tool that will accept a very thin (scaled down), or "surface only" (tessellated model) and "fill in" behind the surface to a sufficient depth to allow printing on a 3-D printer.

To use, open the 3D model in Sketchup Make 2016. It can take stl via a free plugin.

Open Ruby console and paste the contants of backfill_my_model.rb. 

Select and create a group of the model.

Right click and select "Backfill My model option"
